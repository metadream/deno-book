# Deno-Book

A super easy-to-use markdown document preview framework in Deno.

## Demo

https://tech-docs.deno.dev

## Usage

1. Create a start file with any name (ex. `start.ts`) in your document folder
   root. The content of the file is as follows:

```
// start.ts
import "https://deno.land/x/book/mod.ts";
```

2. Create `SUMMARY.md` and `README.md` in your document folder root. The
   contents of the summary will be rendered in the left navigation side of the
   page, and README file will be used as homepage content.

   A typical `SUMMARY.md` contains the following content. Among them, metadata
   between `---` and first-level title are not required.

```
